# asdf-docker

This is my current easy-to-setup development environment based on ArchLinux.
 
## Usage
 
```bash
$ docker run -it -v ~/Developer:/Developer allangarcia/asdf-nodejs
```


*where: **~/Developer** is any directory you want to develop on your local computer, and
        **/Developer** is the directory mounted inside the container.*
